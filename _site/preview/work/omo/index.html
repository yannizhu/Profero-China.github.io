<h4>what did we do?</h4>

<p>OMO is China’s leading brand of detergent, and is owned by Unilever. We regularly create apps for young children to learn while playing games and for families to play together. Such apps have featured events calendars, weather information, recipes, and more. In addition, we created an online platform for consumers to freely ask questions about any aspect of laundry.</p>

<p>As a bonus charity feature, the apps have a counter facility which users contribute to by playing the games. Points earned go towards buying equipment for disadvantaged children.</p>

<h4>how did we do it?</h4>

<li>All of the minisites and applications are built using HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript</li>

<h4>our results</h4>

<p>Through successful consumer engagement for OMO, we have been contracted to work for other Unilever brands. By leveraging social media to support our work for OMO, we were awarded the &#39;<em>Golden Mouse</em>&#39; Gold award for social media in 2013.</p>
