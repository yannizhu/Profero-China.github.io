<h4 id='what_did_we_do'>what did we do?</h4>

<p>We regularly create apps for young children to learn while playing games and for families to play together. Such apps have featured events calendars, weather information, recipes, and more.</p>

<p>In addition, we created an online platform for consumers to freely ask questions about any aspect of laundry.</p>

<p>As a bonus charity feature, the apps have a counter facility which users contribute to by playing the games. Points earned go towards buying equipment for disadvantaged children.</p>

<p>All the minisites and applications are built using:</p>
