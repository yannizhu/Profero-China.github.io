<h4>what did we do?</h4>

<p>We implemented a Facebook application which encourages consumer engagement by running a questionnaire game which was tied to regular competitions and prize draws. It was important to leverage not only the social aspect offered by Facebook&#39;s platform but also the consumer data available.</p>

<p>We implemented features to allow consumers to share content as much as possible, further promoting the brand, while also encouraging them to register as a member and share their Facebook data for further benefits. </p>

<p>We also implemented Google analytics tracking to provide further insight into consumer behaviour and demographics on top of the usage data that Facebook itself provides.</p>

<h4>how did we do it?</h4>

<ul>
<li>rich and animated user interface using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li>.NET framework on the back end for storing consumer data and integrating with Facebook</li>
</ul>

<h4>our results</h4>

<ul>
<li>30,000 monthly active users</li>
<li>Over 9,300 new consumer acquisitions</li>
</ul>
