<p>We implemented a Facebook application which encourages consumer engagement by running a questionnaire game which was tied to regular competitions and prize draws. It was important to leverage not only the social aspect offered by Facebook&#8217;s platform but also the consumer data available.</p>

<p>We implemented features to allow consumers to share content as much as possible, further promoting the brand, while also encouraging them to register as a member and share their Facebook data for further benefits.</p>

<p>We also implemented Google analytics tracking to provide further insight into consumer behaviour and demographics on top of the usage data that Facebook itself provides.</p>

<h4 id='how_did_we_do_it'>how did we do it?</h4>

<p>We accomplished a rich and animated user interface through the use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with the .NET framework on the back end storing the data and integrating with Facebook.</p>
