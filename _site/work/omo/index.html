<h4>what is the opportunity</h4>

<p>OMO is China’s leading brand of detergent, and is owned by Unilever.</p>

<h4>what did we do?</h4>

<p>We regularly create apps for young children to learn while playing games and for families to play together. Such apps have featured events calendars, weather information, recipes, and more.</p>

<p>In addition, we created an online platform for consumers to freely ask questions about any aspect of laundry.</p>

<p>As a bonus charity feature, the apps have a counter facility which users contribute to by playing the games. Points earned go towards buying equipment for disadvantaged children.</p>

<h4>how we did it</h4>

<p>All the minisites and applications are built using:
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS</p>

<h4>our results</h4>

<p>Through successful consumer engagement for OMO, we have been contracted to work for other Unilever brands. By leveraging social media to support our work for OMO, we were awarded the &#39;<em>Golden Mouse</em>&#39; Gold award for social media in 2013.</p>
