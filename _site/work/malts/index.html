<p>Malts is one of Diageo&#8217;s fastest growing brands and incorporates many sub-brands of single malt whiskies. Localised marketing activity for each of these brands is all managed and represented through this website, which we designed, built, and continue to maintain.</p>

<p>The website is built upon a fully customised Content Management System (CMS), deployed to Diageo&#8217;s &#8216;NEO&#8217; platform, and localised specifically for 18 markets. We regularly deploy updates and new sections of the site dedicated to marketing campaigns and competitions. Such competitions often involve interactive content with images, video, and consumer contributions.</p>

<p>One of the website&#8217;s main focuses is on consumer data acqusition. As part of the service we provide to Diageo, we use various technologies to leverage as many sources as possible capture data about the brands&#8217; consumers. We then provide regular reports on the analytics that we gather.</p>
