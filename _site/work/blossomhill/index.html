<p>We implemented a Facebook application which encourages consumer engagement by running a questionnaire game which is tied to regular competitions and prize draws. It was important to leverage not only the social aspect offered by Facebook&#8217;s platform but also the consumer data available.</p>

<p>We implemented features to allow consumers to share content as much as possible, further promoting the brand, while also encouraging them to register as a member and share their Facebook data for further benefits.</p>

<p>We also implemented Google analytics tracking to provide further insight into consumer behaviour and demographics on top of the usage data that Facebook itself provides.</p>
