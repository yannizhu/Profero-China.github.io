#### our role
As one of China's leading brands of detergent, OMO, a Unilever brand, is focused on targeting the increasing domestic consumer base. The market is extremely competitive and fairly tech-savvy with a relatively high proportion of mobile users.

We are engaged in planning, designing, building, and rolling out a stream of online marketing campaigns, supported by social media, minisites, and native applications on handheld devices (iOS and Android).

#### the challenge
* Making a brand of detergent fun and engaging, focusing on family and younger demographics by using rich, playful, and highly interactive content.
* Ensuring device compatibility and speed optimisation for a large proportion of users on handheld devices and slower internet connections.
* Fast turnaround - OMO marketing campaigns are very frequent.

#### the result
Since working on OMO projects, Unilever have since engaged us to work on other brands. In 2013 we were awarded the 'Golden Mouse' *Gold award* for social media for our work on OMO.
