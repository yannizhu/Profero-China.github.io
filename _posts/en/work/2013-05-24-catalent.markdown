#### what did we do?
Catalent prides itself on innovation and so the global website had to reflect that. Therefore we implemented a unique and attractive user interface entirely using CSS and JavaScript. This presented huge challenges in terms of performance and cross-platform compatibility. The website has separate mobile and tablet versions and is localised in 8 languages for markets in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

#### how did we do it?
* Built using HTML, CSS, and a lot of JavaScript
* It was developed for an Apache server, using PHP and Mysql
* EZ Publish is used as the Content Management System for all versions and locales
