#### what is the opportunity?
Master of the Mix is a reality TV series and DJ competition presented by Smirnoff.

#### what did we do?
‘Master of the Mix’ needed to be properly advertised on www.smirnoff.com, so we created a whole section dedicated to this popular event. The design was done by Profero New York, who also maintain the content.

The webpage features:
* Videos and episodes
* The latest news 
* New drink recipes
* More about the cast
* Links for joining  the fan community on Facebook and to follow it on Twitter

#### how did we do it?
* Built using Umbraco as CMS
* Hosted on NEO
* Development enviroments: Visual Studio 2008+, SQL Server 2005 and Windows Server 2003+

#### our results
* Smirnoff.com now receives over *700,000* visits per month and has a conversion rate almost double that of any other Diageo brand.
* In 2012 Profero were awarded the prestigious *Grand Prix* award in Digital Marketing Solutions for a campaign in association with Madonna, which engaged more than *10 million* consumers worldwide.
* It targets in over 140 markets and is localised in multiple languages
