#### what did we do?
Malts is one of Diageo's fastest growing brands and incorporates many sub-brands of single malt whiskies. To keep up with its continuous growth, Malts needed a site up to date, that showcased the wide range of its products.

We provide localised marketing activities for each of these brands, all managed and represented through this website, which we designed, built, and continue to maintain.

We regularly deploy updates and new sections of the site dedicated to marketing campaigns and competitions. Such competitions often involve interactive content with images, video, and consumer contributions. We are constantly refactoring the sites's design and functionality to optimise conversions. As well as the website, we created an accompanying Facebook application, from which users can link their Facebook accounts to Malts.com, and we also provide Diageo with regular analytics reports on the the website's performance and user behaviour.

#### how did we do it?
* The website is built upon a fully customised Content Management System (CMS), EZ Publish
* Itâ€™s deployed to Diageo's dedicated 'NEO' web infrastructure platform
* The website is localised specifically for 18 markets
* Being such a large brand, we cooperate with agencies and organisations all over the world in order to maintain the website

#### our results
Malts.com has over 25,000 active monthly visitors, and a consumer acquisition rate that peaks at 12,000 per month.
