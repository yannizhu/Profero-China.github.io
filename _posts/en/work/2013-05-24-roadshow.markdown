the website

The website leverages Facebook's social media platform to engage consumers by featuring reviews and discussions about the company's products

We created a webpage to list the studios and networks Roadshow Entertainment is in partnership with.

* Connect the profile to the Facebook account

#### how did we do it?
* The website was built on top of the .NET framework
* We used HTML5 and a great deal of JavaScript to offer animations and interactive features.
