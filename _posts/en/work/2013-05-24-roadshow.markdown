#### what did we do?
We created an immersive website for Australia's premier cinema and media company to report all the news related to the most popular films and television series, and for users to form communities around them through discussion in comments and forums, as well as ratings and social media integration.

The website leverages Facebook's social media platform to engage consumers by featuring reviews and discussions about the company's products. It's a social netowork in itself in that users may create personalised profiles, wish lists, and collections which may be shared and which others may interact with. Those profiles can of course be linked to Facebook profiles.

* The website was built on top of the .NET framework
