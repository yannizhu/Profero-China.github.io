#### what did we do?
We implemented a Facebook application which encourages consumer engagement by running a questionnaire game which was tied to regular competitions and prize draws. It was important to leverage not only the social aspect offered by Facebook's platform but also the consumer data available.

We implemented features to allow consumers to share content as much as possible, further promoting the brand, while also encouraging them to register as a member and share their Facebook data for further benefits. 

We also implemented Google analytics tracking to provide further insight into consumer behaviour and demographics on top of the usage data that Facebook itself provides.

#### how did we do it?
We accomplished a rich and animated user interface through the use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with the .NET framework on the back end storing the data and integrating with Facebook.

#### our results
* 30,000 monthly active users
* Over 9,300 new consumer acquisitions
