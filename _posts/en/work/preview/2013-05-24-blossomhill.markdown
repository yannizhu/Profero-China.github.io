tagline: Facebook application for a UK brand
title: Blossom Hill

####our role
Working with a UK-based agency who provided the creative, we implemented a Facebook application which encourages consumer engagement by running a questionnaire game which is tied to regular competitions and prize draws. It was important to leverage not only the social aspect offered by Facebook's platform but also the consumer data available. Therefore we implemented features to allow consumers to share content as much as possible, further promoting the brand, while also encouraging them to register as a member and share their Facebook data for further benefits. We also implemented google analytics tracking to provide further insight into consumer behaviour and demographics on top of the usage data that Facebook itself provides.

####the challenge
Given how many Facebook users are on handheld devices, it was important to make an optimal user experience and not use any potentially incompatible technologies. The target audience are relatively young and tech-savy so a rich design and smooth interface were essential. We accomplished this through the use of HTML5 and built the app functionality using the .NET framework.

####the result
30,000 monthly active users. Over 9,300 new consumer acquisitions.
