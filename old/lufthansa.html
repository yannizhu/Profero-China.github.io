						<h4>Our Role</h4>
						<p>In addition to designing and producing all online banner advertising materials for Lufthansa throughout the APAC region, we actively manage their social networking presence in China.</p>
						<p>In support of these social networking activities, we regularly produce campaign sites to further engage consumers by providing further information on special offers, as well as interactive competitions.</p>
						<h4>The Results</h4>
						<p>In 2012 Lufthansa released their 'non-stop you' campaign, which orients their marketing strategy away from their products and services specifically and onto their consumers; this strategy is also distinct from those of their competitors. The social network activity and work with online advertising that we have carried out have helped make China in particular one of Lufthansa's fastest growing markets, with higher click through rates than in any other region. In 2013 we were awarded the <strong>'Golden Mouse' Gold award</strong> for social media.</p>
